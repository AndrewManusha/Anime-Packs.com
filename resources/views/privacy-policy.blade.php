  <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    When you log in using your Google account, we collect the following:

      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Your display name (from your Google profile)</li>

    This information is used to display your profile, comments, and participation across the site.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How You Can Use the Site</h2>
  <p>
    You can browse and download resource packs without logging in.
    However, to participate in community features (like commenting, voting, submitting suggestions, etc.), you must log in using your Google account.

    We collect anonymous statistics related to:
    <ul>
      <li>Resource pack page visits</li>
      <li>Resource pack downloads</li>
    </ul>
    We also use Google Analytics to analyze traffic and improve our services.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Sessions</h2>
  <p>
    We do not use browser cookies directly, but we use server-side sessions to maintain login state and basic preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Email and Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    A notification system is currently in development. Registered users may receive email or push notifications about new resource packs. You will be able to unsubscribe via your profile settings once available.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties, except:
    <ul>
      <li>When required by law</li>
      <li>To enable essential site services (e.g. Google Analytics)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is stored indefinitely unless you request deletion. Currently, data deletion is possible by contacting us directly. In the future, a self-service option will be available in your profile settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: when you log in, we store only the data necessary for the site to function. If you delete your data, we will forget it. However, the information may still exist in your Google account and can be restored by logging in again.
